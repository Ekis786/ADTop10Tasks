# Top 10 Active Directory Management Tasks with PowerShell

This repository contains my presentation and demo code for common Active Directory management tasks using Windows PowerShell. All material is offered __*AS-IS*__ for educational purposes only. None of the code samples should be considered production-ready. You are welcome to use as much of my demonstration code as you want, but it is __strongly__ recommended that you first test everything in a non-production environment.
