# Top 10 Active Directory Management Tasks with PowerShell

This reposity contains my presentation and demo code for common Active Directory management tasks using Windows PowerShell. All material is offered AS-IS for educational purposes only. None of the code samples should be considered production ready. You are welcome to use as much of the code as you want, but it is __strongly__ recommended that you test everything in a non-production environment.

If you need assistance or further guidance on how to use PowerShell, I recommend you use the free forums at [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org/forums/).
